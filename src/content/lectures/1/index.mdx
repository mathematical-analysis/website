## Lecture 1.

### Real Numbers

Let us start with some standard notation:

- $\emptyset$ is the empty set;
- $\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, \dots\}$, the set of natural numbers;
- $\mathbb{Z} = \{\dots, -1, 0, 1, \dots\}$, the set of integers;
- $\mathbb{Q} = \left\{ \frac{p}{q} \mid p, q \in \mathbb{Z}, q \neq 0 \right\}$, the set of rational numbers;
- $\mathbb{R}$, the set of real numbers.

You are very much used with the real numbers. However, it is not trivial to define them in a rigorous way, see for example the references for different methods of constructing $\mathbb{R}$ from $\mathbb{Q}$. We will straightforwardly start working with the real numbers -- for this reason some of their properties, e.g. the Completeness Axiom below, will simply be stated without giving details. 

**Definition 1.1**
Let $A$ be a subset of $\R$, denoted as $A\subseteq\R$. We define $x\in\R$ to be
	$$
	\text{a \emph{lower bound} for } A \text{ if } x\leq a,\, \forall a\in A;\quad
	\text{ an \emph{upper bound} for } A \text{ if } x\geq a,\, \forall a\in A.
	$$
	We define		
	$$
	lb(A) := \{ x\in \R \mid x\leq a,\, \forall a\in A\} \text{ the set of lower bounds of } A,
	$$
	$$
	ub(A) := \{ x\in \R \mid x\geq a,\, \forall a\in A\} \text{ the set of upper bounds of } A.
	$$
	We define $x\in\R$ to be
	$$
	\text{the minimum of } A \text{ if } x\in lb(A) \cap A; \quad
	\text{the maximum of } A \text{ if } x\in ub(A) \cap A,
	$$
	denoted by $\min(A)$, respectively $\max(A)$. In other words, we have that
	$$\min(A)\in A \text{ and  }\min(A)\leq a,\, \forall a\in A; \quad
	\max(A)\in A \text{ and } \max(A)\geq a,\, \forall a\in A.
	$$

Note that there are sets which do no have minimum or maximum, e.g. $(0,1)$.

**Definition 1.2**
A set $A\subseteq\R$ is defined to be:

	- bounded (from) below if $lb(A) \neq \emptyset$;
	- bounded (from) above if $ub(A) \neq \emptyset$;
	- bounded if it is both bounded below and above;
	- unbounded if it is not bounded.

### Supremum and infimum

**Definition 1.3**
We say that \( x \in \mathbb{R} \) is the *supremum* of \( A \subseteq \mathbb{R} \), \( x := \sup(A) \), if and only if:
1. \( x \geq a,\, \forall a \in A \), that is \( x \in ub(A) \).
2. If \( u \) is an upper bound for \( A \), then \( x \leq u \).

The supremum is the *least upper bound*, i.e. \( \sup(A) := \min(ub(A)) \).

**Definition 1.4**
We say that $x\in\R$ is the **infimum** of $A\subseteq\R$, $x:=\inf(A)$, if and only if:

1. $x\leq a,\, \forall a\in A$, that is $x\in lb(A)$.
2. if $u$ is a lower bound for $A$, then $x\geq u$.

**The infimum is the greatest lower bound**, i.e. $\inf(A):= \max(lb(A))$.

**Definition 1.5 (Completeness Axiom)**
Every set $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above has a supremum. Similarly, every set $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded below has an infimum. 

Note that if $A$ has a maximum, then $\sup(A) = \max(A)$. Similarly, if $A$ has a minimum, then $\inf(A) = \min(A)$. Also, if $\sup(A) \in A$, then $\max(A) = \sup(A)$.

**Example 1.6**
(a) $A = \{ \frac1n \mid n\in \N\},\, \sup(A) = 1 = \max(A),\, \inf(A) = 0,\, \nexists \min(A)$.

(b) $A = \{ x\in \Q \mid x^2 \leq 2\},\, \sup(A) = \sqrt{2},\, \nexists \max(A),\, \inf(A) = -\sqrt{2},\, \nexists \min(A)$.

**Theorem 1.7**
Let $A\subseteq\R$ be a bounded set. For $\sup(A)$ and $\inf(A)$ the following are true:
$$
\forall \varepsilon > 0,\, \exists x\in A \text{ such that } \sup(A)-\varepsilon < x,
$$
$$
\forall \varepsilon > 0,\, \exists x\in A \text{ such that } x < \inf(A) + \varepsilon.
$$
**Proof.** By definition, for any $y < \sup(A)$, say $y = \sup(A)-\varepsilon$ with $\varepsilon>0$, we have that $y\notin ub(A)$. Hence there exists $x\in A$ such that $y < x$. Similar proof for $\inf(A)$.

**Proposition 1.8**
Let $A\subseteq B\subseteq \R$ be (nonempty) bounded sets. Then
		$$
		\inf(B) \leq \inf(A) \leq \sup(A) \leq \sup(B)
		$$
		and
    $$
		\sup(A\cup B) &= \max\{\sup(A),\, \sup(B)\},\\
		\inf(A\cup B) &= \min\{\inf(A),\, \inf(B)\}.
    $$
**Proof.** It follows directly from the definitions.

**Definition 1.9**
Define the \emph{extended real line} $\overline \R := \R \cup \{-\infty,\infty\}$, where $\infty$ and $-\infty$ are such that
		$$\forall x\in \R,\, -\infty < x < \infty.$$

		If a set $A$ is not bounded above, we define $\sup(A):= \infty$.

		If a set $A$ is not bounded below, we define $\inf(A):= -\infty$.

### Neighborhoods. Interior. Closure #neighborhoods-interior-closure

**Definition 1.10**
A set \( V \subseteq \mathbb{R} \) is a *neighborhood (vicinity)* of \( x \in \mathbb{R} \) if

\[
\exists \varepsilon > 0 \text{ such that } (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon) \subseteq V.
\]

A set \( V \subseteq \mathbb{R} \) is a *neighborhood* of \( \infty \) if \( \exists a \in \mathbb{R} \text{ such that } (a, \infty) \subseteq V. \)

A set \( V \subseteq \mathbb{R} \) is a *neighborhood* of \( -\infty \) if \( \exists a \in \mathbb{R} \text{ such that } (-\infty, a) \subseteq V. \)

We denote all the neighborhoods of \( x \) by \( \mathcal{V}(x) := \{V \subseteq \mathbb{R} \mid V \text{ is a neighborhood of } x\} \).


**Definition 1.11**
Let \( A \subseteq \mathbb{R} \). The following set is called the *interior* of \( A \)

\[
\mathrm{int}(A):= \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid \exists V \in \mathcal{V}(x) \text{ such that } V \subseteq A\},
\]

and the following set is called the *closure* of \( A \)

\[
\mathrm{cl}(A):= \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid \forall V \in \mathcal{V}(x),\, V \cap A \neq \emptyset\}.
\]

**Proposition 1.12** {#prop:inclusions_int_cl}
For any \( A \subseteq \mathbb{R} \), it holds that \( \mathrm{int}(A) \subseteq A \subseteq \mathrm{cl}(A) \).

**Proof.** To prove that \( \mathrm{int}(A) \subseteq A \), we prove that if \( x \in \mathrm{int}(A) \), then \( x \in A \). Let \( x \in \mathrm{int}(A) \), then \( \exists \varepsilon > 0 \) such that \( (x-\varepsilon,x+\varepsilon) \subseteq A \). Since \( x \in (x-\varepsilon,x+\varepsilon) \), we have that \( x \in A \).  
To prove that \( A \subseteq \mathrm{cl}(A) \), we show that if \( x \in A \), then \( x \in \mathrm{cl}(A) \). Let \( x \in A \). Then for any \( V \in \mathcal{V}(x) \), it holds that \( x \in V \), giving that \( x \in V \cap A \). Hence, \( x \in \mathrm{cl}(A) \) since \( V \cap A \neq \emptyset \).

**Definition 1.13**
If \( A = \mathrm{int}(A) \), then \( A \) is called *open*.  
If \( A = \mathrm{cl}(A) \), then \( A \) is called *closed*.

**Remark 1.14**
To prove that a set \( A \) is open, it is sufficient to prove that \( A \subseteq \mathrm{int}(A) \).  
To prove that a set \( A \) is closed, it is sufficient to prove that \( \mathrm{cl}(A) \subseteq A \).

**Proposition 1.15** {#prop:complement_open}
The following statements are true:
- The complement of an open set is closed.
- The complement of a closed set is open.

**Proof.** Let us prove the first statement, the other one being similar. Consider \( A \) an open set, i.e. \( A = \mathrm{int}(A) \), and denote by \( A^{\mathrm{c}} = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x \notin A\} \) its complement. To prove that \( A^{\mathrm{c}} \) is closed, we prove that \( \mathrm{cl}(A^{\mathrm{c}}) \subseteq A^{\mathrm{c}} \). Consider \( x \in \mathrm{cl}(A^{\mathrm{c}}) \) and let's assume that \( x \notin A^{\mathrm{c}} \), i.e. \( x \in A \), aiming to obtain a contradiction. Since \( A \) is open, there exists \( V \in \mathcal{V}(x) \) such that \( V \subseteq A \), giving that \( V \cap A^{\mathrm{c}} = \emptyset \): contradiction with \( x \in \mathrm{cl}(A^{\mathrm{c}}) \). Hence, the assumption \( x \notin A^{\mathrm{c}} \) is false, and we have that if \( x \in \mathrm{cl}(A^{\mathrm{c}}) \), then \( x \in A^{\mathrm{c}} \). In other words, \( \mathrm{cl}(A^{\mathrm{c}}) \subseteq A^{\mathrm{c}} \).

**Proposition 1.16**
Any union of open sets is open. Any intersection of closed sets is closed. Any finite intersection of open sets is open. Any finite union of closed sets is closed.

**Proof.**
